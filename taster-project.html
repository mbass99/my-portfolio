						<h2 class="section-header">Branding</h2>
						<h3 class="section-questions">what were our thoughts about the product?</h3>
						<p>Researched potential names and logos, starting with mind maps thinking about different types of alcohol. When and where are they drank the most? How might each make you feel? For instance - Beer might be more casual at a sporting event, vs Champagne at more proper at a black tie wedding.</p>

						<img src="Images/mind-map.png" class="mind-map">
						<h3 class="section-questions">how did we land on the name &amp; logo?</h3>
						<p>The idea was to create a logo, organically and connected to the name of the product. Multiple versions of logos as well and names, were iterated starting with hand drawn sketches. before moving to polished digital versions. </p>

						<img src="Images/hand-drawn-logo.png" class="hand-drawn">
						<p class="taster-text">Taster stuck and the market expanded past wine connoisseurs, and the logo functioned as the “T” in the name.</p>
						<h3 class="section-questions">what was the process for fonts?</h3>
						<p>The ideal pairing was a fancy branding font, with a serif/sans-serif for body copy. Here are some of the 20 pairing attempts which didn't make the cut, and later in the process. </p>

						<img src="Images/old-font-styles.svg" class="previous-attempts" alt="previous fonts">
						<!--					<img src="Images/previous-font-attempts.png" class="previous-attempts">-->

						<p class="font-text">Pacifico became the brand font reminiscent of Instagram. Coustard / Arimo / Bookman Old Style / Lato were all attempted as pairings with Pacifico. </p>

						<!--					<img src="Images/fonts-with-color.png" class="previous-attempts">-->
						<!--					<p>Eventually the final versions were also tested over colors </p>-->

						<p class="font-text"> Arimo's readability didn't scale as well and was replaced with Lato. It's versatility, also allowed us to also replace Bookman Old Style on buttons for simplicity</p>

						<p class="font-text">Below is the final output after continual refining and user testing. Pacifico was removed from menu use as some users thought it was harder to read than it needed to be </p>

						<h2 class="section-header">Conclusions</h2>
						<h3 class="section-questions">what did we learn?</h3>
						<p class="project-conclusion-text">Testing is invaluable, and needs to be done early and often. There were times which I tried to overdesign screens and users were able to break me out of a sense of tunnel vision. For instance, as an accent I initially had three of my supplementary colors lining the bottom of each screen, but during some of the clickable prototype testing, I was alerted that it didn’t register with them to be related to wine colors, so they were removed. </p>
						<p class="project-conclusion-text">Two things I suspected as a fellow consumer that were reinforced upon talking to users - people value their privacy, and want simplicity from their interfaces.
						</p>
						<p class="project-conclusion-text">It also allowed me to simplify my typography, as users were gravitating towards multiple fonts, leading me to strip back what I was using for a more organized and refined version. It also reinforced the idea of the cursive font working well for the brand, as well as creating a color style based off grape colors, as those were always well documented thumbs up for the users. </p>
						<p class="project-conclusion-text">This journey allowed me realize what the story was along the way, that this would be an application driven by community. People want processes democratized, and to share their life with people they know and trust, as an evolution of the global digital open world we’re moving further and further into.</p>
						<h3 class="section-questions">if I had more time...</h3>
						<p class="project-conclusion-text">I would further explore the idea of a design that is app based, vs responsive web. The metrics are shifting, and it would be interesting to know which makes more sense as a baseline product to create.</p>

						<p class="project-conclusion-text">I might try to further refine the organization for content, to see if things could be even more simplified.</p>

						<p class="project-conclusion-text">While I am happy with the typography chosen, there are countless options that with more time, there could be additional exploration of what might work, particularly in finding a more elegant/refined button on the landing page.</p>
