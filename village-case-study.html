						<p>Stronger communication builds stronger community bonds. Additionally parent involvement in early children's education is a big key to the child's educational success. </p>
						<br>
						<p>However there isn't one product that does everything well for parent/teacher communication for instance some are better with visual communication, some better with text</p>

						<h3>Challenge</h3>
						<p>Build a streamlined app that focuses on giving users what they need, without the pitfalls of other products.</p>

					<h3 class="section-thoughts">Conclusions</h3>
					<p>Shutterfly has the widest usage of individual applications, followed by Class Dojo, then Email. Shutterfly is best for pictures and weak on text, where Class Dojo excels mainly with text. Email is incredibly versatile, but the fact that everyone has one yet additionally uses something else for school, speaks to the desire for an arena specific product</p>

				<!--BRANDING-->
				<section class="village-branding">
					<div class="height-section-borders"></div>
					<h2 class="village-section-header">branding</h2>
					<p>Before adding color and images, we needed to establish some branding separately so understand what colors or images to use. The idea was to evoke the idea of a comfortable educational environment, with colors remeniscent of the classroom environment, as well as quickly scannable fonts for parents on the go.</p>
					<h3>Naming Rights</h3>
					<p>Because the thrust of the idea was to build a "Community" that was the original name of the project.</p>
					<p>However as the process moved along the proverb <span class="quote">"It takes a village to raise a child"</span> arose, and the decision was made that "Village" made for a stronger anchor title for the brand.</p>
					<h4>For a deeper dive into the naming process, we've included the below link</h4>
					<!--link to deeper dive-->
					<h3>Typography</h3>
					<p>Pulling from the surveys we learned many parents were either overwhelmed with the amount of messages, or were on the go and didn' have time to fight with unreadable text</p>
					<p>Because of that we needed text that was simplified and readable, drawing their attention to important information.</p>
					<p>After trying multiple options, <span class="seriff-font">PT Seriff </span>became the header font, with <span class="sans-seriff-font">Montsteratt</span> pulling body copy duty.</p>
					<h4>For a deeper dive into the font process, we've included the below link</h4>
					<!--link to deeper dive-->
					<h3>Logos</h3>
					<p>Your first and lasting view of what this product is, should be directly tied to the logo.</p>
					<p>During the logo process we pivoted from one name to another, so that changed what we might create.</p>
					<p>Each attempt was tied to school, be that artwork, school busses or what was used in the classroom</p>
					<p>Eventually we landed on using a pencil because it was remiscint of No.2 pencils that we all used in the classroom, and could also be used as a both a standalone logo, or fit within the name.</p>
					<!--insert final logos-->
					<div class="village-final-logo-and-name">
						<img src="Images/village-branding-logo-damn-good-pencil-main.png" alt="final pencil logo">
						<img src="Images/final-village-large-logo.png" alt="final full name logo">
					</div>
					<h4>For a deeper dive into the font process, we've included the below link</h4>
					<!--link to deeper dive-->

					<h3>Landing Page Image</h3>
					<p>We needed something to stick in people's minds and allow them to easily understand what this product might be upon first glance.</p>

					<p>Three versions of a landing page image were tested, with <span class="branding-results">80%</span> preferring the image of the colored pencils</p>

					<h3>Colors</h3>
					<p>Like the logos, we wanted to evoke colors reminscent of the classroom experience.</p>
					<p>Because of that we decided to lean on yellow and green because it builds off the logo, can be used to establish heirarchy with one another, and feels directly tied to school from busses to pencils</p>

					<h4>For a deeper dive into the font process, we've included the below link</h4>
					<!--link to deeper dive-->

					<h3>Putting skin on the bones</h3>
					<p>Now comes the time to take the lo-fidelity mock up pages, and add the branding process on top of those, to create the polished high-fidelity mock up pages</p>
					<p>To create a testable the MVP, a few processes that were more lightly requested (Sign Up Pages) were pulled back on to focus on the core and most requested processes (Sign Up, Communication).</p>
					<h4>Final Landing Page</h4>
					<!--				insert landing page-->
					<img src="Images/village-hifi-landing-page.jpg" class="village-hifi-pages" alt="village final hifi landing">

					<h3>Invision Testing</h3>
					<p>Two rounds of user testing in Invision was done to see what was working or not working for people, and then iron out any issues. The user flows were understood, but there were other things that needed refinement.</p>

					</div>

					<h4>Color Refinement</h4>
					<p>The colors were initially a more diverse swath of colors, occasionally action based to grab attention, but were further refined for simplicity, subtlety and brand alignment, creating the dominate pallate of Green and Yellow</p>

					<div class="village-button-transformation-story">
						<!--buttons-->

					</div>
					<p>Red headers or buttons with a red background, became green.</p>

					<p>Folder labels went from light blue, to the primary forrest green</p>
					<div class="village-folder-text-color-change">
						<!--				insert old picture and new homework page-->


					</div>
					<h4>About Pages</h4>
					<p>The mini pitch deck pages felt a bit text heavy for readers, and inconsistent with the use of images and background color.</p>

					<p>Images were added to the top of all pages for consistency</p>

					<div class="village-about-images-consistency">



						<!--			let us help your image flourish (pg 60 on slide)-->
					</div>

					<p>Text blocks felt a bit heavy on the eyes, so they were broken up to ease reader strain, which also allowed for a bit of branding via image.</p>

					<div class="village-images-to-about-pages">
						<!--				page 61 slides add about pages images-->
					</div>


					<p>While it's use was consistent, users didn't like an occasional light yellow background, so it was removed</p>

				<!--CONCLUSIONS	-->
				<section class="village-conclusions">
					<div class="height-section-borders"></div>
					<h2 class="village-section-header">conclusions</h2>
					<p>This was something I was passionate about upon embarking on this discovery and creation. Talking to fellow parents opened my eyes to what they might want to see from this app, as things like being able to track homework wasn’t a process I would have thought of. Also being able to bounce ideas off my wife (potential user) was ever so helpful as she helped the name tweak as well as the logo idea.</p>
					<h4>What worked?</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>Final Branding (photos/colors etc)</li>
						<li>The process - users understood navigation</li>
					</ul>
					<h4>what didn't work?</h4>
					<ol>
						<li>Initial Color Palatte needed slimming down and refinment</li>
						<li>Intiial name felt stale and generic</li>
						<li>Early logos weren't scaling right</li>
						<li>About pages worked better in desktop but jarring in mobile</li>
					</ol>
					<h3>If I had more time....</h3>
					<p>I would build out more screens, adding different processes to sign up for events, or donate to them from the app. Refine the images a bit more, possibly using them as a background instead of just at the top of the page.
						Visual refinement, can always be better, as can being a bit more inventive with how you can reinvent navigation around a site while still seeming natural</p>
					<h3>Doubts going into the project?</h3>
					<p>I wasn’t sure how wide the market was, or if there was a specific enough niche for this to make a difference.
					</p>
					<h3>What surprised me?</h3>
					<p>How many people use e-mail for these functions. Also how many of the other apps don’t do all of the same things, and how people like getting their messages directly in the app.</p>
					<h3>What I Learned?</h3>
					<p>The notion of how an IOS App really wants users to take a walk through the process while signing up. While I understand that, I think users also want to just get into the app and go.</p>
					<p>Also, how hard it is to scale things in a logo, even when you strip it down to just boxes and lines</p>

					<h3>How I'll Use That Later On...</h3>
					<p>I’ll find a more stripped down way to introduce a product in those pre-sign up pages, maybe adding in a way to skip through it.</p>
					<p>For logo refinement I’ll try to fight my urges to overdo things and just use simplicity. I thought I had created a nice, accurate pencil logo only to realize it didn’t scale because there were too many moving parts, and removing things that might move within the visual helps that from happening.</p>
