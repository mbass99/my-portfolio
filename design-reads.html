                <p>We discovered that <b>aspiring UX Designers</b> struggle to discover beneficial <b>learning
                    materials</b>
                  and enjoy <b>communicating</b> with like-minded individuals who share the same educational goal.
                  We believe that connecting them by providing a <b>space for sharing</b> beneficial material benefits
                  aspiring designers while they <b>gain confidence</b> within their field.</p>

                <p>DesignReads aims to create an <b>environment</b> for UX Designers to share beneficial reading
                  material.
                  In the space, designers can <b>rate, review, and discuss</b> popular resources including books, blogs,
                  videos, and articles. This space will allow designers to <b>search topics</b> applicable to their
                  <b>interest</b>
                  while gauging <b>content strength</b> from reviews and ratings.
                  <p>For clarity of roles, the sections where I operated as UX Designer have an all caps header, and
                    those as a project manager are regular camelcase</p>

                    <p>Users found that having the add button here was confusing for two reasons.
                      First, it was <b>too similar</b> to the add button on the menu bar.
                      Second, they expected the button to be <b>below the add content section</b>.
                      They didn’t expect to travel back up the screen to find the button.</p>

                    <p>The add content icon was changed to a button to give it <b>more distinction</b>.
                      The button was placed <b>towards the bottom</b> ofthe add content screen so they users
                      would not have to navigate backup the screen to save.</p>

                    <p>Users found that the content added screen was too similarto the former screen.
                      They thought the flow should finishwith a more <b>distinct screen</b> to show that the flow was
                      <b>completed</b>.</p>

                      add
                      content flow.
                      The card now displays on the <b>trending feed</b> instead of having its own page.
                      The card <b>mimics</b> the cards used through out the rest of the application and
                      displays that the content is added. </p>

                    <p>Being that add is <b>universal</b>, we removed the label and made the icon <b>larger</b>.
                      Adding content is an important aspect of the application and <b>more

            <section class="case-study-conclusion">
              <h3 class="case-study-section-header">Conclusion</h3>
              <p>Being that this was my first project working with a <b>group of other designers</b>, I faced many
                unique
                challenges. In the past, my design decisions
                were never challenged by others yet when working with a team of designers, everyone had an opinion. Our
                <b>biggest challenge</b> was when we were working on
                the high fidelity mockups. We had varying ideas of how the style should be implemented. We realized that
                while the styling of the original high fidelity mockups
                worked for Android, they did not adhere to iOS Standards. Therefore, we decided to create a <b>version
                  for
                  both</b> that could express our individual style preferences. While this
                solution worked for our passion project, in a <b>professional setting</b>, we would have A/B tested the
                two
                prototypes and let data decide which was best.</p>

              <p>Also, being that I worked as a <b>project manager</b> for this project, I realized how hard managing a
                team
                can be. It is challenging to <b>organize people</b>, keep
                everyone on a timeline, and work meetings into busy schedules. I found that using a <b>kanban board</b>
                allowed us to implement a modified sprint method,
                so we each could select the tasks we had time to complete for a given week. I also found that using a
                <b>time tracker</b> to record how
                much time we spent on a single task allowed us to be more <b>productive</b> and held us
                <b>accountable</b>
                to our weekly commitments.</p>

              <p>Staying organized is a huge aspect of the UX design process and working with a group makes it
                important.
                I
                learned that having each team
                member <b>document their process</b>, decisions, and findings in a shared space is extremely valuable.
                Having a shared space to document the project not only helps
                with writing the <b>case study</b> once the project is complete, but can also save hours that are spent
                in
                meetings.</p>
