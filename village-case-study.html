			<section class="village-project-overview">
				<h2>Project Overview</h2>
				<h3>Problem</h3>
				<p>Stronger communication builds stronger community bonds. Additionally parent involvement in early children's education is a big key to the child's educational success. However there isn't one product that does everything well for parent/teacher communication for instance some are better with visual communication, some better with text</p>
				<br>
				<h3>Challenge</h3>
				<p>Build a streamlined app that focuses on giving users what they need, without the pitfalls of other products.</p>

					<h3>Conclusions</h3>
					<p>Shutterfly has the widest usage of individual applications, followed by Class Dojo, then Email. Shutterfly is best for pictures and weak on text, where Class Dojo excels mainly with text. Email is incredibly versatile, but the fact that everyone has one yet additionally uses something else for school, speaks to the desire for an arena specific product</p>

				<h3>Conclusions</h3>
				<p>Many people surveyed consider themselves very involved in their children's education, and believe a strong community around the school benefits everyone. They also desire detailed information about what is happening in the classroom, and are more often IOS users.</p>

				<h3>Before adding color and images, we needed to establish some branding separately so understand what colors or images to use. The idea was to evoke the idea of a comfortable educational environment, with colors remeniscent of the classroom environment, as well as quickly scannable fonts for parents on the go.</h3>
				<h3>Naming Rights</h3>
				<p>Because the thrust of the idea was to build a "Community" that was the original name of the project.</p>
				<p>However as the process moved along the proverb <span class="quote">"It takes a village to raise a child"</span> arose, and the decision was made that "Village" made for a stronger anchor title for the brand.</p>
				<h4>For a deeper dive into the naming process, we've included the below link</h4>
				<!--link to deeper dive-->
				<h3>Typography</h3>
				<p>Pulling from the surveys we learned many parents were either overwhelmed with the amount of messages, or were on the go and didn' have time to fight with unreadable text</p>
				<p>Because of that we needed text that was simplified and readable, drawing their attention to important information.</p>
				<p>After trying multiple options, <span class="seriff-font">PT Seriff </span>became the header font, with <span class="sans-seriff-font">Montsteratt</span> pulling body copy duty.</p>
				<h4>For a deeper dive into the font process, we've included the below link</h4>
				<!--link to deeper dive-->
				<h3>Logos</h3>
				<p>Your first and lasting view of what this product is, should be directly tied to the logo.</p>
				<p>During the logo process we pivoted from one name to another, so that changed what we might create.</p>
				<p>Each attempt was tied to school, be that artwork, school busses or what was used in the classroom</p>
				<p>Eventually we landed on using a pencil because it was remiscint of No.2 pencils that we all used in the classroom, and could also be used as a both a standalone logo, or fit within the name.</p>
				<!--insert final logos-->
				<img src="Images/" alt="final pencil logo">
				<img src="Images/" alt="final full name logo">

				<h4>For a deeper dive into the font process, we've included the below link</h4>
				<!--link to deeper dive-->

				<h3>Colors</h3>
				<p>Like the logos, we wanted to evoke colors reminscent of the classroom experience.</p>
				<p>Because of that we decided to lean on yellow and green because it builds off the logo, can be used to establish heirarchy with one another, and feels directly tied to school from busses to pencils</p>

				<h4>For a deeper dive into the font process, we've included the below link</h4>
				<!--link to deeper dive-->

				<h3>Styleguide</h3>
				<p>For a full and concise look at how the colors and fonts should be used, we've linked to the final styleguide below</p>
