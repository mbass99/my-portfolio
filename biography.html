			<!--WHY DESIGN-->
			<div class="bio-flex">
				<section class="one">
					<div class="no-background">
						<h1 class="about-me">About Me</h1>
						<div class="icon-text-designer">
							<h2 class="bio-question-red">Why design?</h2>
							<img src="images/good-designer-group.png" class="why-design" alt="why design">
						</div>
						<div class="icon-text">
							<img src="images/designer.png" class="designer" alt="designer">
							<p>Design has been in the background of my interests for a long time, I just didn’t always realize how.</p>
						</div>
						<p class="text-center">In high school, I designed golf courses on a computer program. Putting myself in the shoes of the players, I loved charting a challenging, yet fair and visually appealing path through each hole.</p>
						<img src="images/golf-group.png" class="golf-group" alt="golf-designer">


						<p class="text-center">That program lead me to initially becoming an Architecture major in college, before realizing designing didn’t want to design buildings. I then turned to my love of story and eventually graduated from Film School.</p>

						<div class="school">
							<img src="images/architect.png" class="architect" alt="architect">
							<img src="images/film-camera.png" class="film" alt="film">
						</div>

						<p class="text-center">I spent the next two decades helping develop other people’s stories, but I was always wanting to do more.</p>

						<p class="text-center">During a UI/UX informational class which explained how the discipline involved research, making things look nice and functional, as well as simplify the experience for the user - I knew that was my path.</p>

						<p class="text-center"><span class="bio-italics">UI/UX combined that creative itch I used to scratch with that golf game, with my abilities to develop narrative content.</span></p>

				<!--DESIGN IMPORTANCE-->
				<section class="two">
					<div class="background">
						<h2 class="bio-question-black">The Importance Of Design</h2>
						<div class="icon-text">
							<img src="images/storyboard.png" class="storyboard" alt="storyboard">
							<h3 class="mini-subhead">Design tells a story</h3>
						</div>
						<div class=""></div>
						<p class="text-center">When you use a product, you are on a journey, be that to learn information, listen to a song or watch a movie, or see someone’s personal pictures they posted.</p>
						<div class="icon-text">
							<img src="images/frustrated-face.png" class="frustrated" alt="frustrated-user">
							<h3 class="mini-subhead">When design is bad, you get frustrated at the experience</h3>
						</div>
						<p>Frustration means you and may give up the chase for what you’re looking to do, in favor of something that annoys you less than a broken journey.</p>

						<p>Good design gives you a connection as a user to the brand, and vice versa. If the journey is stimulating, it’s something you’ll come back to. If you pick the right colors, the right logos, it will entice people to come to your product for repeat engagement. </p>
						<div class="icon-text">
							<img src="images/chaplin.png" class="chaplin" alt="charlie-chaplin">
							<h3 class="mini-subhead">Think of design as characters in a great TV show</h3>
						</div>
						<p>You accompany these people week in and out on a journey together, because you’re connected to them, and their goals as characters</p>
					</div>
				</section>
				<!--DESIGN APPROACH-->
				<section class="three">

					<div class="no-background">
						<h2 class="bio-question-red">How I Approach design, And what I’d change</h2>
						<p>I’m a consumer, and try to put myself in the shoes of users when I create something. I strive for prefer simple, logical and engaging design.
						</p>
						<div class="icon-text">
							<img src="images/privacy.png" class="privacy" alt="privacy">
							<p>Privacy is something I’m passionate about. so my kids have the opportunity to carve their own path, without having their entire life pre-mapped by any by product scrubbed from my data. </p>
