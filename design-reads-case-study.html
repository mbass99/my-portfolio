            <p>We discovered that <b>aspiring UX Designers</b> struggle to discover beneficial <b>learning
                materials</b>
              and enjoy <b>communicating</b> with like-minded individuals who share the same educational goal.
              We believe that connecting them by providing a <b>space for sharing</b> beneficial material benefits
              aspiring designers while they <b>gain confidence</b> within their field.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3 class="case-study-problem-statement">Solution</h3>
            <p>DesignReads aims to create an <b>environment</b> for UX Designers to share beneficial reading material.
              In the space, designers can <b>rate, review, and discuss</b> popular resources including books, blogs,
              videos, and articles. This space will allow designers to <b>search topics</b> applicable to their
              <b>interest</b>
              while gauging <b>content strength</b> from reviews and ratings.

                <p>Users found that the content added screen was too similar to the former screen.
                  They thought the flow should finish with a more <b>distinct screen</b> to show that the flow was
                  <b>completed</b>.</p>

                <p>The added content now <b>becomes a card</b> when added instead of sharing the same layout with the
                  add
                  content flow.
                  The card now displays on the <b>trending feed</b> instead of having its own page.
                  The card <b>mimics</b> the cards used through out the rest of the application and
                  displays that the content is added. </p>

        <!--Conclusion-->
        <section class="case-study-conclusion">
          <h3 class="section-header">Conclusion</h3>
          <p>Being that this was my first project working with a <b>group of other designers</b>, I faced many unique
            challenges. In the past, my design decisions
            were never challenged by others yet when working with a team of designers, everyone had an opinion. Our
            <b>biggest challenge</b> was when we were working on
            the high fidelity mockups. We had varying ideas of how the style should be implemented. We realized that
            while the styling of the original high fidelity mockups
            worked for Android, they did not adhere to iOS Standards. Therefore, we decided to create a <b>version for
              both</b> that could express our individual style preferences. While this
            solution worked for our passion project, in a <b>professional setting</b>, we would have A/B tested the two
            prototypes and let data decide which was best.</p>

          <p>Also, being that I worked as a <b>project manager</b> for this project, I realized how hard managing a team
            can be. It is challenging to <b>organize people</b>, keep
            everyone on a timeline, and work meetings into busy schedules. I found that using a <b>kanban board</b>
            allowed us to implement a modified sprint method,
            so we each could select the tasks we had time to complete for a given week. I also found that using a
            <b>time tracker</b> to record how
            much time we spent on a single task allowed us to be more <b>productive</b> and held us <b>accountable</b>
            to our weekly commitments.</p>

          <p>Staying organized is a huge aspect of the UX design process and working with a group makes it important. I
            learned that having each team
            member <b>document their process</b>, decisions, and findings in a shared space is extremely valuable.
            Having a shared space to document the project not only helps
            with writing the <b>case study</b> once the project is complete, but can also save hours that are spent in
            meetings.</p>
