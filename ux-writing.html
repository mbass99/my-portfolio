                    <p>Coming from content development in Film/Television, I’ve always been involved in what the story
                        is, and how it’s being told. UX writing is no different, as it requires clarity & brevity, done
                        in a tone in line with what you need the user to feel. </p>
                    <p>Having this background, and experience, I decided to do the <a href="https://dailyuxwriting.com/"
                            target="_blank">Daily UX writing challenge</a> to explore
                        and improve my writing skills when writing alerts and messages.</p>
                    <p>Too many words and the message gets lost, and the user loses interest. A joyful tone for an error
                        login message if the user can’t access their bank account, will only frustrate them.
                        Alternatively, their exercise app not cheer them on when they achieve their daily goal, doesn’t
                        entice them to continue working out!</p>
                    <p>As with all UX based design, its an important balance to engage users without confusing them.
                        Wanting to show flexibility, when appropriate the tone was apologetic, or cheeky.</p>
                    <p>Because each scenario may often have alternate tones or increased clarity depending on what is
                        required,
                        to illuminate how I worked through options and arrived at the the final versions, each challenge
                        separates out final from alternate options.</p>

                            <p>Airline travel is stressful, and the industry generally needs to convey a
                                sense of calm and trust, without agitation. Therefore this solution is about clarity and
                                easing emotional stress, with a likely universal tone. </p>
                            <p>In my solutions, I tried to be a straight forward, and concise as possible, while
                                conveying empathy in a frustrating customer situation. Tonal flexibility is less likely
                                an option, and the exercise was heloful to focus clarity of message. </p>

                            <p>My thought here was a product aimed at parents who don't want to feel guilty that they
                                were missing out something they <span class="writing-bold">used</span> to be able to do.
                                So as a parent, while live sports can be exciting, being a responsible parent is
                                important and I wouldn't want the FOMO.</p>
                            <p>For my solutions, I tried to convey that tone. Particularly in the header content, to be
                                clear and unemotional at a quick glance. This app helps you keep on top of things you
                                can't follow as closely anymore, because they're no longer the most important thing in
                                life. Though I didn't go that route, I could see the tone of the messages potentially
                                eliciting a more excitable response from a user if it was in line with the brand.</p>
