					<h3 class="section-questions">visualization of the design process</h3>
					<p>After exploring potential hand sketch options, moved to more defined digital iterations with DrawIO/Axure. Below are digital iteration for the dashboard, signing in/up, and data security. The goal of these mockups is to show how the user might navigate back and forth through the site.</p>
					<h3 class="section-questions">dashboard</h3>
					<p>How would we organize the dashboard, and what functions need to be created? Primary needs were the creating/saving/organizing of notes, shared networks, and folders. Additionally there was the need to handle administrative issues, like Account Settings and Messages</p>

The two versions here listed are dashboard/adding notes, and data security.</p>

					<p>The idea was to be simple with only each section on the dashboard, and adding specific content within each section. Users asked about a clear “add note” button on the dashboard, so that was addressed.</p>

					<p>Based on the importance of privacy, we always needed to keep the idea of how the product would address security in the back of our head. Users again wanted something simple and obvious, letting you know how your data was controlled.</p>

			<!--BRANDING-->
			<section class="ten">
				<div class="background">
					<h2 class="section-header">Branding</h2>
					<h3 class="section-questions">what were our thoughts about the product?</h3>
					<p>Researched potential names and logos, starting with mind maps thinking about different types of alcohol. When and where are they drank the most? How might each make you feel? For instance - Beer might be more casual at a sporting event, vs Champagne at more proper at a black tie wedding.</p>

					<img src="images/mind-map.png">
					<h3 class="section-questions">how did we land on the name &amp; logo?</h3>
					<p>The idea was to create a logo, organically and connected to the name of the product. Multiple versions of logos as well and names, were iterated starting with hand drawn sketches. before moving to polished digital versions. </p>

					<img src="images/hand-drawn-logo.png">
					<p>Taster stuck, opening up the product past wine connoisseurs alone, with the logo functioning as a “T” in the name.</p>
					<h3 class="section-questions">what was the process for fonts?</h3>
					<p>Below are some of the 20 pairing attempts eventually the final versions also were tested over colors. The hope was to have a fancy font for branding, paired with seriff or sans-seriff fonts for body copy and buttons. </p>

					<img src="images/previous-font-attempts.png" class="previous-attempts">

					<p>Pacifico became the cursive brand font as it was reminiscent of Instagram and felt bold and classy. Coustard / Arimo / Bookman Old Style / Lato were all attempted as pairings with Pacifico. </p>

					<img src="images/fonts-with-color.png" class="previous-attempts">

					<p> Arimo was replaced when it became a bit harder for users to read once it was in larger formats, and it was replaced with Lato. Bookman Old Style was being used solely for buttons, but because Lato was simple and bold with a wide variety of options, it became the main font used.</p>

					<p>User testing was continually done, refining the look. Pacifico was scaled back from use on the menu as some users believed it was harder to read than it needed to be. Below is the final version. </p>

					<div class="image-center">
						<img src="images/grapes.png" class="wine-colors">

					<p>Multiple color versions were tested to user preferences, eventually landing darker primary grape colors for the primary usage. Users really responded to the boldness of the purple, and connection with both wine tasting.</p>

					<p>Two versions of a landing page were attempted - the lighter came into play when visibility became an issue. 75% of those tested preferred the darker option, which ended up a strong choice once I was finally able to make the font visibility work as needed.</p>

						<img src="images/landing-dark.png">

					<p>For the logo, the desire was to have the corkscrew as part of the “T” in the logo. A/B testing was done with users, 83% confirming my design decision to use the logo as part of the name.

					<p>The next to last version of the landing page was tweaked for simplicity after user conversations, adding an obvious button on the bottom to create a new account, and single sign in link on the top. That allows current users to see the ability to sign in right away, and also emphasize the body content of what this is, leading new users down to the create account button.</p>

						<p>The dashboard organization went through multiple iterations and tests. Users preferred adding content from up top, so that process was moved from where it was in the lo-fi versions.

			<!-- CONCLUSIONS-->
			<section class="twelve">
				<div class="background">
					<h2 class="section-header">Conclusions</h2>
					<h3 class="section-questions">what did we learn?</h3>
					<p class="project-conclusion-text">Testing is invaluable, and needs to be done early and often. There were times which I tried to overdesign screens and users were able to break me out of a sense of tunnel vision. For instance, as an accent I initially had three of my supplementary colors lining the bottom of each screen, but during some of the clickable prototype testing, I was alerted that it didn’t register with them to be related to wine colors, so they were removed. </p>
					<p class="project-conclusion-text">Two things I suspected as a fellow consumer that were reinforced upon talking to users - people value their privacy, and want simplicity from their interfaces.
					</p>
					<p class="project-conclusion-text">It also allowed me to simplify my typography, as users were gravitating towards multiple fonts, leading me to strip back what I was using for a more organized and refined version. It also reinforced the idea of the cursive font working well for the brand, as well as creating a color style based off grape colors, as those were always well documented thumbs up for the users. </p>
					<p class="project-conclusion-text">This journey allowed me realize what the story was along the way, that this would be an application driven by community. People want processes democratized, and to share their life with people they know and trust, as an evolution of the global digital open world we’re moving further and further into.</p>
					<h3 class="section-questions">if I had more time...</h3>
					<p class="project-conclusion-text">I would further explore the idea of a design that is app based, vs responsive web. The metrics are shifting, and it would be interesting to know which makes more sense as a baseline product to create.</p>

					<p class="project-conclusion-text">I might try to further refine the organization for content, to see if things could be even more simplified.</p>

					<p class="project-conclusion-text">While I am happy with the typography chosen, there are countless options that with more time, there could be additional exploration of what might work, particularly in finding a more elegant/refined button on the landing page.</p>
