                <section class="ux-writing-intro">
                    <p>Coming from content development in Film/Television, I’ve always been involved in what the story
                        is, and how it’s being told. UX writing is no different, as it requires clarity & brevity, done
                        in a tone in line with what you need the user to feel. </p>
                    <p>Having this background, and experience, I decided to do the Daily UX writing challenge, to flex
                        and improve my writing skills when writing alerts and messages.</p>
                    <p>Too many words and the message gets lost, and the user loses interest. A joyful tone for an error
                        login message if the user can’t access their bank account, will only frustrate them.
                        Alternatively, their exercise app not cheer them on when they achieve their daily goal, doesn’t
                        entice them to continue working out!</p>
                    <p>As with all UX based design, its an important balance to engage users without confusing them.
                        Wanting to show flexibility, when appropriate the tone was apologetic, or cheeky.</p>
