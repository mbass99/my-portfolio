                <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
                <h3>Value Proposition</h3>
                <p>Despite having a variety of internal tooling and a strong developer culture, Riot had an external design system for players, but not one focused on supporting game management tools. Players and developers have different goals and needs, and each needs a design system to reflect those user bases.  There was value in creating a unified tooling design system, which might streamline the development process, ensure consistency across teams and products, and reduce technical debt and reliance on external frameworks</p>
            <h3>Problem to solve</h3>
            <p>Building and maintenance of a design system can be time and resource consuming.  Part of those resources also involve planning, alignment and goals, to build in a manner that can be scaled out to retain long term value as additional teams use the system. Additionally products and teams have different needs, and centralized alignment is needed to retain consistency.</p>
            <p>Lacking a centralized or defined solution, meant teams often spun up different internal tooling, with UI that that served similar use cases as ones already in existence on other teams, but presented differently.  This meant duplicate work and maintenance, and sometimes a diminished level of polish or user experience, due to a lack of time or design input when created. A unified system could improve consistency and experience, while making it easier to create features across teams with increased efficiency.</p>
            <h3>How did we decide to build this?</h3>
        <p>This was initiated when the EM on my team was talking to another team, and discovered we were both spinning up separate portals.  They were scoped to create of a design system, and we had broader reach and the potential to help with implementation. Alignment and leveraging of both teams meant we could potentially provide wider org value, particularly since the goal of our portal was the ability for other teams integrate with our product, and move their workflow there.</p>    
        </section>
        <section class="project-audience">
            <h2>Who are we designing for?</h2>
            <p>For both teams working on this project, Developers would be the primary users of the system.  Often dealing with lots of information in one location, they require a balance of information density and clarity.  Documentation allowing them to quickly pull an element from storybook, and have it work regardless of what team built it, and saving time due to any unneeded customizations.  The developer workflow is often in code editors and github, which are prone to accidental errors, and we could, and should improve that experience when moving their process to a new location. </p>
            <p>The secondary audience our team needed to support were less technical users (such as product managers, qa engineers, producers and designers). They are often less comfortable in code editors and github, so we needed processes and UI that help guide them along without always requiring a developer to hold their hand through completing a task, as was the current workflow.</p>

        <section class="project-scope">
            <h2>Timeline & Budget</h2>
            <p>This would be merging two work-streams already in progress, and we needed to adjust and align. The UI contractor who begun the work for the other portal had a limited scope focused on the needs of the other portal, with under 6 months left on his contract, so we couldn’t derail that work from completion. </p>
       <p>Using the baseline of what he had in place we needed to figure out where the gaps existed so we could expand upon that initial work.  This included fleshing out elements for a broader experience, as well as defining and and standardizing best practices for design system consistency across products and use cases.</p>
       <p>Additionally, there were two scope changes that occurred while we were in flight on the work, in addition to more general broad internal company pivots and teammate shuffling. We needed to rework our typography to align with separate work being done across other teams. Additionally, the other portal pivoted away from the work they had started, no longer required a custom design system and stepped away from the project. </p>
        </section>
        <section class="project-process-overview">
            
            <h2>What did we do, and why?</h2>
            <p>Riot was growing and had limited design representation at that time within their developer platform initiative, so we had somewhat limited resources between myself and the one other designer. We needed to jump into each others workflows, and have frequent communication meetings, as well as async conversations in slack and Figma comments.</p>
        <p>Creating usability and consistency on the ground floor, could prove incredibly valuable to multiple teams and the organization as a whole, particularly since there was hope that a good portion of core internal game features could be housed under the hood of our portal.</p>
        <p>His initial work was focused around tables, and some account navigation and menus, based around the specific dataset goals of his stakeholders. We needed to scale out from there to create the ground floor for broader use cases, and built out a “to-do” list in figma.</p>
        <p>Embedded in the developer side of the house meant easy access to prospective users and their products, to understand their workflow patterns and best practices.</p>
        <p>Using competitive analysis from products like Amazon, Epic and Firebase, we looked to understand those developer centric products.</p>

        <h3>UX Patterns</h3>
        <!--ADD SENTENCES OR LISTS-->
        <p>Content was designed for density, readability and clarity, given the data intensive workflows we were building towards.</p>
        <p>Appropriate guard rails within our flows and processes were important, which included use of modals, colors and intentional button placement to identify potential positive and destructive actions within task flows.  Where possible we wanted to try and reduce destructive human errors, such as accidental clicks and “fat finger” inputs.</p>
        <p>Presented instructions on features created for power users, which intentionally included less guard rail friction than a guided process.</p>
        <p>Guidance around how to organize content hierarchies consistently, using tabs to separate out related features and data sets.</p>
        <p>Use features to expedite task completion such as “type to complete” in search fields, and copy/paste functionality in data fields.</p>
        <p>Drive information discoverability through a guide not hide mindset, and making data accessible vs inaccessible in drop-downs.</p>
        <p>Refined menu functionality and hierarchy, improving usability and scalability.</p>

                <p>Elements were created based on atomic design methodology.</p>
                <p>We refined the color scheme for usability, and standardized color definition to identify success and error states.</p>
            <p>Revamped the top navigation and user settings for clarity, which allowed us to create an access based system for Rioters to access all of their portals through one location. </p>    
        <p>Riot had a broader initiative around updating their fonts, and brought that visual designer in to make sure we had proper alignment, and could create the proper mix of information density adn clarity for our users.</p>    
        <p>Created reusable template pages for errors that helped users identify what potentially may have happened, and return to their previous location.</p>

            <h2>What were the results?</h2>
       <!--Add Content-->
       <p>For our portal, we built the first pass with the old designs, then revamped the site with the new design elements when it launched live to the organization.</p>
       <p>The feedback was positive, as we were able to create a clean interface that simplified the users workflow, within a complicated system.  Implementing metrics to track usage was part of post-MVP work.</p>     
       <p>Ad-hoc conversations with developers around the org across teams were had to obtain feedback, understand what was or wasn’t working for them, how they used the workflows, and what we could improve etc. </p>
       <p>With our portal now live, other teams were looking to build their features within our system.  Designers on other teams were able to reduce their design time due to what we had in place in Figma.  We also provided helpful guidance about and support to designers and developers on other teams about best practices to retain consistency across features and products.  This is where things took a turn.</p>
       <h2>What would we have done differently?</h2>
              <!--Add Content-->
              <p>While the design system was an early success upon launching our portal, several months down the road things had changed.  We were a group of teams with different goals building together. Priorities shifted within initiatives, which also meant reduced manpower and communication between teams, and we were still in process of creating a system of documentation.  As other teams began integrating with our portal, those builds were frequently breaking, partially due to our custom UI library. This resulted in the decision to scrap our custom system for a generic alternative to remove the friction in the workflow.</p>
        <p>As part of the conversation around this decision, we mused that design systems often have standalone teams dedicated to their building and maintenance, which wasn’t the case here.  Additionally, the other team scrapped their plans, which then meant we were responsible for shouldering more of the workload than we initially planned.  So while a valid attempt to create consistency and provide cross team value, there was too much change with broader internal roadmaps to continue what we started.</p>

    <h2>My Project Impact + Process</h2>
     <!--Add Content-->
     <p>I was already operating as a full stack designer on our portal, doing everything from research through copy.  I began working with the external contractor to align on needs and relevant experiences across competitive products.  We wanted to create a system of best practices that refined what was in place, and expanded upon it.</p>
    <p>As part of our research, I found patterns that made sense to implement helping create consistency, improve usability and keep the users focus on the primary goals at hand.  I started with the tables, since that affected the timeframe of the contract designer. </p>
    <div class="show-and-tell-flex"></div>
    <div class="tell">
    <p>Placed the “create new” CTA button on the top right side above the headers for consistency, keeping it in view while not directly distracting away from the data in the tables</p>
    <p>We retained flexibility for teams to include additional columns as needed for features, but focused on showing top level data that shouldn’t be hid by any “view more” functionality.  If additional context was requested, rows could be expanded to show additional data in a card underneath the primary information.</p>
    <p>Data comprised primarily of numbers was right aligned, while text was left aligned, based around typical patterns and making it easier to scan.</p>
    <p>Advocating for accessibility, I aimed to make the best experience possible and we discussed achieving AA or AAA standards.  Eventually we landed on a midpoint between the two, because achieving AAA contrast while great, felt like overkill and would be overly cumbersome to achieve for MVP.  This meant slight tweaks to the colors used in UI such as error messages, where red and yellow pallets can present challenges.</p>
    <div class="show-and-tell-flex">
        <div class="tell">
    <p>I used our existing portal designs as a first stop of understanding the types of additional elements that we needed to create a baseline to build out additional elements that we redesigned our portal using the new elements as a jumping off point. Because our needs were broader, UI that we required could serve as a template for the expanded design system.</p>

    <h3>What ended up happening?</h3>
  <!--Add Content-->
      <p>Our portal launched, and while the work is never done, our MVP felt polished, usable and consistent to developers and game teams.  Information was clear and organized, with a lot more to come.</p>
      <p>That said, moving things forward with the design system didn’t end up happening and we eventually deprecated the entire project.  </p>
<li>Elements were implemented inconsistently, and we didn’t have a strong enough QA process in place to track problems.  Being able to take more time and care with how things were implemented may have changed the eventual outcome, or not.</l>
<li>Additionally, once partner teams started integrating with our portal, their builds were consistently and the inconsistencies with how the custom components were implemented seemed to be the source of the friction. To alleviate the problems, we made the decision to move stop using the custom components, and use an external framework.</l>   
<li>As much as we may have documented things in Figma, it wasn’t clear that was enough, given the outcome. Riot later moved to notion as the source of documentation, which may have alleviated some of the challenges, as some non-designers are more comfortable than others working in Figma.</li>
