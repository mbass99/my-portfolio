                <h2 class="cms-overview-header">Overview</h2>
                <p>I was brought in by Inward Eleven to help rethink the UX on CMS’s existing wordpress site. The
                    site needed a modern design aesthetic, and better optimization for mobile and responsive web
                    users. The client did some market research to find educational sights they liked.</p>

                <h5 class="cms-sub-header">Initial Research</h5>
                <p>We dug into the existing SEO to understand how the site was working
                    for existing users. We then walked through CMS’s market research, putting together initial ideas of
                    changes to implement. </p>

                <h3 class="cms-questions">Problems To Solve</h3>
                <p>Meeting with the client, we discussed specific elements to change.</p>
                <h5 class="cms-sub-header">Clean, Modern Design</h5>
                <p>The site needed to be brought up to date to match current trends</p>
                <h5 class="cms-sub-header">Information Architecture</h5>
                <p>Redesign the menu, optimizing it for mobile. Clarify and re-organize sections of the menu to
                    reduce clutter. </p>
                <h5 class="cms-sub-header">Selling The School and Images</h5>
                <p>Create a visual way to sell their instructors, the experience of their graduates, and breadth of
                    that network. </p>
                <h5 class="cms-sub-header">Data Input</h5>
                <p>Many students contact the school and research them years ahead of potential enrollment. Those
                    prospective students needed the ability to input their data and contact information, so the
                    school could keep in contact with them. </p>
                <br>
                <p>After the meeting we had a map how the process should evolve, based on what was important. A
                    responsive design, and delivering mocks for each size of mobile/tablet/desktop. </p>
            </section>
            <section class="cms-problem-solved">
                <h3 class="cms-questions">Design Solutions</h3>
                <h5 class="cms-sub-header">Overall Redesign</h5>
                <p>Redesign key pages and create a template for future pages. We targeted the landing, forms,
                    instuctor, course schedule, housing, blog, tuition and class pages</p>
                <h5 class="cms-sub-header">Mobile Optimization</h5>
                <p>Since the majority of users were on mobile devices, catering to them first was key. Typing on a
                    phone is harder than a computer, so I found ways to ease that data input whenever possible with
                    click wheels.

                </p>
                <p>Research &#40;and anyone who has used a phone&rpar; shows users fingers and hands primarily at
                    the bottom of the phone, so I moved the menu on mobile to a bottom static position to ease
                    potential user discomfort. I also created direct links via icons to the primary actions (home,
                    apply etc).</p>
                <h5 class="cms-sub-header">Information Architecture</h5>
                <p>I reorganized the menu information to be more streamlined, and while it addressed the issues, the
                    first desktop pass didn’t resemble the exact design what they wanted. So that needed a second
                    pass to rethink and pull from one of their references, which then worked perfectly for the
                    client.</p>
                <h5 class="cms-sub-header">Images - Selling The School</h5>
                <p>Particularly because the school sells a visual medium, these needed to be bold. Edge to edge
                    image sections were created for mobile for still images of the faculty, and videos explaining
                    the
                    courses. A system was also created, setting things into a grid format, and setting a heirarchy
                    within the faculty members. Because they cater to a younger audience. we also gave the user an
                    ability to swipe between images/videos.</p>
                <p>To show the story of their alumni success, charts were set up that would visualize the numbers
                    they wanted to show. </p>

            <section class="cms-end-result">
                <h3 class="cms-questions">End Result</h3>
                <img src="/Images/cms-final-mobile-landing.png" class="cms-wireframes" alt="cms final mobile landing">
                <p>I only focused on the low-fidelity structure, so full redesign is still in process. But the
                    client was very excited with these designs. They were then handed off to a visual designer,
                    hired to create animations specific to the brand for the final design (blood drippingto fill in
                    chart numbers, monster hands as menu icons etc). </p>
                <p>They really loved the forward thinking on mobile, of a menu pinned to the bottom, and the click
                    wheels for data input ease. Several of the sites also had a very dynamic visual site, so I
                    wanted to make sure if we used a similar format, that text readbility over images and video
                    wouldn’t be an issue.

                </p>
                <p>Getting good client direction is also incredibly helpful, so when the desktop menu wasn’t up to
                    snuff for them, specifics as to what needed to change made it easier to implement the desired
                    changes</p>
                <p>Adding detail down to the little things, and brand knowledge creates a sense of comfort for the
                    client. Creating “cheeky” UX copy felt more personalized than lorem ipsum text.
                    Putting their site address in the browser bar further personalizes the design for the client.
