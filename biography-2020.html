                <p>How did I end up doing UX, what makes me unique, and how do I put it all together as a designer? It
                    involves an array ofl skills and experiences which mesh together and help make me stronger designer.
                    Each involves understanding how to engage and interact with people - the core of UX Design.</p>

                <p>My path to design involves 10+ years prior experience in content development for film & tv. Before
                    that,
                    I was on the architecture path to design golf courses.</p>

                <div class="architecture-grid">
                    <p>My view on golf course design was creating an experience taking a player &#40;“the user”&#41;, on
                        a
                        journey through 18 holes &#40;“the product”&#41;. My design intent was challenging but fair,
                        with
                        thought out, structured decisions. I understood how each sand trap, water hazard, or tree
                        &#40;“user
                        obstacle”&#41; provided a choice for how to proceed &#40;“the user flow”&#41;. </p>

                </div>
                <p>In retrospect, that mindset and experience informs on two UX fronts. Understanding user goals
                    &#40;minimizing strokes/clicks &#41; helps structure information architecture. Seeing user
                    impediments &#40;water hazards /confusing interfaces &#41;, helps guide them around those obstacles.

                <div class="bio-entertainment-one">
                    <p>My entertainment experience is a bit closer aligned. Design is product storytelling for users. My
                        content development was storytelling with a viewer as the end user. That path entailed material
                        showing a unique point of view &#40;creative goals&#41; that also found an audience
                        &#40;business
                        goals&#41;. </p>

                    <p>If a new soapy, network drama was a product, what would that design process look like? The
                        research may turn up a female demographic, who respond to interpersonal relationships with
                        tension, but would prefer a unique hook. Good market and user research helps find the middle
                        ground between unique and familiarity.</p>

                    <p>Introducing a new or unique element, requires problem solving. A plot twist is like a new
                        function,
                        and the user should understand why it’s there for the benefit of that journey. And unless you
                        want
                        them to find another product that serves them better, don’t frustrate or bore them.</p>

                <p>My UX thinking was apparent trying to make sure everything was understood by a potential audience.
                    Testing the process with reads from fresh eyes helps identify previously missed weak spots. Solving
                    story problems also meant understanding ramifications each decision made on a final product - from
                    casting, to budget, to the potential audience. The goal was to bridge creative and business goals,
                    to find an audience while feeling unique.</p>

                    <p>Being parent also bolsters these tools. It requires daily listening and learning, to make
                        educated
                        decisions about someone else’s experience.</p>

                <p>This unique path, along with putting myself in the shoes of users, is what makes me a strong UX team
                    member. It all adds up to experience creating something that affects and entices people. Good UX is
                    like good story and character development - it only improves the final product.</p>
