                    <p>How did I end up doing UX, what makes me unique, and how do I put it all together as a designer?
                        It
                        involves an array of skills and experiences which mesh together and help make me stronger
                        designer.
                        Each involves understanding how to engage and interact with people - the core of UX Design.</p>

                    <p>My path to design involves 10+ years prior experience in content development for film & tv.
                        Before
                        that,
                        I was on the architecture path to design golf courses.</p>

                        <p>How is this a natural progression you say? Let me explain...</p>

                    <div class="architecture-grid">
                        <p>My view on golf course design was creating an experience taking a player &#40;“the
                            user”&#41;, on
                            a
                            journey through 18 holes &#40;“the product”&#41;. My design intent was challenging but fair,
                            with
                            thought out, structured decisions. I understood how each sand trap, water hazard, or tree
                            &#40;“user
                            obstacle”&#41; provided a choice for how to proceed &#40;“the user flow”&#41;. </p>

                    </div>
                    <p>In retrospect, that mindset and experience informs on two UX fronts. Understanding user goals
                        &#40;minimizing strokes/clicks &#41; helps structure information architecture. Seeing user
                        impediments &#40;water hazards /confusing interfaces &#41;, helps guide them around those
                        obstacles.

                        <p>My entertainment experience is a bit closer aligned. Design is product storytelling for
                            users. My
                            content development was storytelling with a viewer as the end user. That path entailed
                            material
                            showing a unique point of view &#40;creative goals&#41; that also found an audience
                            &#40;business
                            goals&#41;. </p>

                        <p>If a new soapy, network drama was a product, what would that design process look like? The
                            research may turn up a female demographic, who respond to interpersonal relationships with
                            tension, but would prefer a unique hook. Good market and user research helps find the middle
                            ground between unique and familiarity.</p>

                        <p>Introducing a new or unique element, requires problem solving. A plot twist is like a new
                            function,
                            and the user should understand why it’s there for the benefit of that journey. And unless
                            you
                            want
                            them to find another product that serves them better, don’t frustrate or bore them.</p>

                    <!-- INSERT DOORS IMAGE -->

                    <p>My UX thinking was apparent trying to make sure everything was understood by a potential
                        audience.
                        Testing the process with reads from fresh eyes helps identify previously missed weak spots.
                        Solving
                        story problems also meant understanding ramifications each decision made on a final product -
                        from
                        casting, to budget, to the potential audience. The goal was to bridge creative and business
                        goals,
                        to find an audience while feeling unique.</p>

                    <p>This unique path, along with putting myself in the shoes of users, is what makes me a strong UX
                        team
                        member. It all adds up to experience creating something that affects and entices people. Good UX
                        is
                        like good story and character development - it only improves the final product.</p>
