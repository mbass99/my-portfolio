    <H4>noun, often attributive
            vil·​lage | \ ˈvi-lij
            \</H4>
            <p>1a : a settlement usually larger than a hamlet and smaller than a town</p>
            <p>b : an incorporated minor municipality</p>
            <p>2 : the residents of a village</p>
            <p>It takes a village to raise a child is an African proverb that means that an entire community of people must interact with children for those children to experience and grow in a safe environment. The villagers look out for the children. This does not mean an entire village is responsible for raising your children or the children of a crowd. </p>
