      <h2>Project Background</h2>
      <p>Scaling from a single to a multi-game platform, meant a historical change in requirements as teams were built and operated. Along the way to launch there’s a lot of trial and error, and historical code complexities when you’re getting off the ground.  Process knowledge comes and goes with the teammates creating a knowledge gap, and short term solutions eventually become tech or design debt. Our goal was to understand and deliver a “best practices” experience, that works for all teams, allowing new teams to create their own process so they could build and scale quickly, without forcing existing teams to migrate from their current workflow.</p>

      <h3>Project Overview</h3>
      <!--Insert text or list-->
      <li>From the initial launches of League Of Legends to VALORANT, a lot changed. Process, technology, capabilities, the whole company!  </li>
    <li>Different visions and requirements across teams meant process divergence, so code structure and process didn't always align from one team to the next.</li>   
    <li>Teams incur tech debt, people leave the company, and process knowledge may not get transferred. Along the way, the dots may not be connected. </li>  
    <li>Different teammates have different needs, knowledge, and comfort levels, so we need to account for a wide user base.</li>  
    <li>Don't force immediate adoption of our solutions in a manner that causes friction and disruption.</li>

      <li>Understand each teams process, and see how that translates towards scalable best practices, particularly in lieu of any current example.</li>
      <li>Make it easy for less proficient users to complete tasks, without adding friction for power users requiring customization, or upending any existing processes.</li>
      <li>Reduce human errors and create guard rails preventing costly and time consuming errors, especially those which may have been preventable.</li>
      <li>Become the process source of truth across teams, then codify that within documentation and the workflows we create.</li>
      <li>Assist teams and users onboard onto a platform and process that didn’t exist.</li>
      <li>This was a very iterative process with us all  learning along the way, along with pivots reflecting new requirements.</li>

      <li>Deliver a game management hub that allows existing workflows to be managed with a centralized UI database, initially focused on specific features.</li>
      <li>Solution that can scale across teams and features, reducing cost and workflow friction.</li>
   <li>We initially implemented read only process to limit scope, and get functionality off the ground.  At the same time, we were looking at what creation and edit functionality would look like within the same workflow.  Once we were able to visualize the structure within the UI, we could back what it looked like to create and make changes to those elements.</li>
  <li>Because there was no existing solution to what we were creating, and a team that had a strong insight and view onto internal processes, we had a lot flexibility to define and adjustdiv</li>

       <h2>User Research & Competitive Analysis</h2>
       <p>What we built was a combination of our own unique developer team insights, and expectations reflecting developer experience across products.  Product, design and engineering worked together to understand how the features currently worked, and how we might create a scalable path towards the future.</p>

      <h3>User Research</h3>
      <p>Our team was primarily developers, and had already built up a base of research reflecting friction points and needs of users. As things progressed, we would speak to developers across teams to gain additional insights as to what they need or would like to see within our portal.</p>

        <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
        <li>Internal tooling use cases can differ from company to company, with some functional overlap.  We created our own accounts on competition to test out use cases, and see where we could implement those solutions into our experience.</li>
        <li>We focused on, but didn't limit ourselves to the process of competitive game development examples.  Developers are familiar with external products like AWS or Cloudflare, which they are already familiar with, or may be part of their workflow.  So it made sense to explore a wide range of solutions, reflecting potential developer experiences.</li>

       <!--Section Title-->
       <h2>UX Mocks</h2>
       <li>Because we were creating read-only visualizations that needed to reflect code elements, our flows were often screen-to-screen changes, rather than individual step by step boxes.</li>
      <li>As a designer, I was also working off technical documents outlining functionality. I used those to build a hierarchical form that represented specific elements detailing the experience interacting with those pieces.</li>
    <li>There was no existing design baseline, and this was internal facing and didn’t require the same Riot external branding as other teams.  So we made the decision to use more mid than low fidelity mocks, to expedite feature and process visualization.</li>
